# [CBank] Simple Bank System in C

This is a basic C program that simulates a simple bank system. It allows users to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check account balances. This project is great for learning C programming and understanding how to work with structures, input validation, and a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new bank account by providing their name, birth date, address, postal code, and an ID document type (e.g., Passport, ID). The system ensures that users are at least 18 years old.
- **Deposit Funds**: Allows users to deposit a positive amount into their account.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Allows users to withdraw a positive amount from their account, as long as they have sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of a specified account.
- **Menu-driven Interface**: A simple text-based menu for easy navigation.
